# Nationwide Interest Survey on the ETEEAP–BS Social Work Program for DSWD Personnel

## Form Description

The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), through the DSWD Academy, continues to strengthen the professionalization of the social welfare and development (SWD) workforce by supporting pathways for formal academic recognition of competencies acquired through formal and informal capability development interventions and related years of public service.

As part of this commitment, the DSWD Academy is exploring the implementation of the **Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP)** leading to a **Bachelor of Science in Social Work (BSSW)**, in partnership with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).
